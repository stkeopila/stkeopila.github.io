                <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Stanley</strong> where I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am currently a second year computer science major 
                and some of my hobbies are video games, sports, gym, and impulse shopping!</p>
                <p>This year I hope to make an impact on my community and want to pursue my dream of creating projects that can be useful to people.</p>
