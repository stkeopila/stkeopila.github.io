                            one of my favorite bakeries to go to. This place a wide range of bread which can range from really sweet to very savory.

                        <p> This was a sad day, I saved up enough points for a free pizza. I sat down and
                            I have never eaten something as hard as that pizza in my life. The pizza tasted good but was rock hard. 
                            I also had my favorite boba from <strong>TPTea</strong> which is the Taiwanese Classic Milk Tea. Couldn't save 
                            pizza... 2/10

                        <p> My friends and I went to <strong>Taishoken</strong> which is located in <strong>San Mateo, California</strong> 
                            where they specialize in <strong>Tsukemen</strong> which is basically a dipping noodle. However my friend decided to order a 23 dollar appetizer which was called
                            <strong>Tuna Tartare</strong>. It was good but not 23 dollars good. 6/10

                            cake. The face it had on the cake was too cute to eat so we cut it off and put it on a seperate plate to admire it. Cake was mid. 4/10
